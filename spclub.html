<h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>Swimming can be an excellent hobby — and workout — for people of all ages and fitness levels. It’s low-impact, builds strength and fitness, and is fun. Swimming is an activity that involves coordination of arm and leg motions to propel your body through water. Those motions demand a lot of effort to overcome water’s natural resistance, meaning you’ll certainly strengthen your muscles when you swim. But swimming is primarily a form of cardiovascular exercise which keeps our body fit. </p>
<p>When you swim for exercise, you get a total-body workout, which means that most of your muscles are involved, which can improve muscle strength. There are four strokes used in swimming: backstroke, butterfly, breaststroke, and freestyle. Each style requires different muscles to work to varying degrees. And our club is offering a swimming club so that you and your friends can both learn as well as practice swimming both for a competitive way and a friendly way!</p><br><br><center><img id="t" src="https://www.tysonsreporter.com/files/2020/06/marcus-ng-ZbbhkQ0M2AM-unsplash.jpg"></img></center>

A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may only be struck once by each side before it passes over the net.</p>
